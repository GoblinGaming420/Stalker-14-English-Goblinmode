 Attention Stalker!

 Starting Out -

 Go up and left to find your personal stash, inside there is a repository (blue vending machine) that contains 3,000 roubles and 2 starter kits containing very basic gear. You can change tabs on the repository to find different sections, don't forget to check your money.

 Earning Money -

 Mutants: Kill mutants and butcher them for parts, which you can sell at Sidorovich. Other factions / Other traders may buy those parts at higher prices.

 Artifact Hunting: More experienced Stalkers can earn even more money by hunting for artifacts! However, this can be dangerous!

 Fishing: Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime as the old saying goes. Fishing is a reliable and cheap way to make some roubles- not the most profitable but one of the safest methods.

 Watch Out!

 The zone can be dangerous. You can throw bolts in front of you to check for anomalies and once you're comfortable walking around you can head deeper into the zone.

 HELPFUL INFORMATION

 Recommended Loadout: Decent shotgun, 7mm shotgun rounds, knife, bolt bag, and some meds. (If you lose all your starter gear and are soft locked AHELP for assistance)

 Laying on a bed heals you, no need to even sleep!
